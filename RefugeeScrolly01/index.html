	<h1>Journey of the Displaced</h1>

  <p>Over the past several years, the world has been faced with the displacement of Congolese refugees. Thousands of men, women and children have been forced from their homes in the Congo and have taken refuge overseas in the states. As of January 2014, almost half a million refugees had fled the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) making the DRC refugee population the sixth larget in the world. Refugees like, Musa, is one of the many have taken that journey in hopes of resettlement. Here is his story.<br><br>

	      <p>   At the age of 16, Musa and his family were attacked by rebel soldiers. His dad was killed, his mother's leg was broken and his sisters were raped in front of them while inside their home.<br><br>

	     Various conflicts since the 1960s have created Congolese refugees, and refugees from the DRC now represent 18 per cent of the total refugee population in Africa.<br><br>
